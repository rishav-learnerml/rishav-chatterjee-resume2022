          <h1>Rishav Chatterjee</h1>
        <h2>B.Tech'2022 IT Undergraduate</h2>

        <p>Hello World!! I'm Rishav, a Full Stack Developer, a Competitive Programmer, a Machine Learning and Data Science enthusiast and above all - an aspiring SDE.
            <br><br>
            I'm looking for opportunities in the corporate world as my aim is to do big, I'm learning each and everyday about new technologies and I'm getting deeper into them. You can have a look at  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12AjTkYkOIUo6wAxzB3L_dgMaH1a6NMlB/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">My Resume</a>
            <br><br>
            From developing projects to doing research-works and by solving problems I'm upgrading myself each day to get better than yesterday. I would be eager to work in any field, not limited to the ones listed above, and I would consider it worthwhile to take up projects out of my comfort zone in an environment that would foster learning at an even pace. </p>

            I collected the data from Govt. website about the corona-virus outcome and built a Machine Learning and Data Science Project .
